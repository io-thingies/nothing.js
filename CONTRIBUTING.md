## How can I contribute to this project?

We're naturally inclined to be including of everyone, but in order to maintain the essence and consistency of our project we need to ensure people do not start contributing anything, which I think we all agree would be counter-intuitive.

We're in the process of forming a **`nothing`**<sup>.js</sup> Wide-open Task Force whose goal will be to provide a document to outline the rules governing the community contributing to **`nothing`**<sup>.js</sup>  together with a set of best practices to guide your efforts. As long as you can understand and follow those rules you can definitely contribute your ideas and we're looking forward for you to be part of our team.

	
> **`nothing`**<sup>.js</sup> special!
There were and still are many who say **`nothing`**<sup>.js</sup> is impossible to achieve. We'd like to think otherwise.
If you think you're one of us we ask you to join the team. Or even surprise your whole team by registering them as well! Together we can make **`nothing`**<sup>.js</sup> better!
>
> You may note there's no registration yet - it's one of the things we need help with.. let us know if you have solved these type of meta-registration problems before. We want to hear from you!
