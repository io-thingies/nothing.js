Through our efforts and forward thinking at **`nothing`**<sup>.js</sup> 
the original nothing.js file has been removed.

Before that, it was free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

We note though, that before that happened anyone was free to copy, modify, 
publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this software, either in 
source code form or as a compiled binary (our preference), for any purpose, 
commercial or non-commercial, and by any means. Not anymore.

In jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author (referred elsewhere 
in plural to sound layery) of this software dedicate any and all copyright 
interest in the software to the public domain. We make this dedication for the 
benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and
successors. We intend this dedication to be an overt act of
relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to this
software under copyright law.

AGAIN, THIS SOFTWARE WAS ONCE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
IN NO EVENT CAN THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
